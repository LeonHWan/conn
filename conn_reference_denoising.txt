In addition, functional data were denoised using a standard denoising pipeline [CITATION2] including the regression of potential confounding effects characterized by

#line_summary1
From the number of noise terms included in this denoising strategy, the effective degrees of freedom of the BOLD signal after denoising were estimated to range from [VALUE 1 QC_DOF_min] to [VALUE 1 QC_DOF_max] (average [VALUE 1 QC_DOF_mean]) across all subjects[CITATION7].

#line_summary2
After outlier removal there were an average of [VALUE 1 QC_ValidScans_mean] functional scans/acquisitions per subject (ranging from [VALUE 1 QC_ValidScans_min] to [VALUE 1 QC_ValidScans_max]).

#line_summary3
Residual inter-scan motion (also computed after outlier removal) was [VALUE 1 QC_MeanMotion_mean]mm on average, ranging from [VALUE 1 QC_MeanMotion_mean]mm to [VALUE 1 QC_MeanMotion_mean]mm.
