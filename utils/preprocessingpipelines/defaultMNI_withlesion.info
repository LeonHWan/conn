Default MNI Direct-normalization pipeline with structural lesions
Suggested for cases when subjects present structural lesions that may negatively
impact the quality of preprocessing normalization/segmentation steps

In addition to the default MNI pipeline steps this pipeline uses a mask of 
each subject structural lesion to improve the structural and functional 
normalization steps. It does so by masking the lesion area during the
structural normalization step and creating an extended Tissue Probability 
Map that incorporates a lesion tissue class to improve the functional
normalization step. This pipeline also normalizes the lesion ROI to
MNI space for further analyses

Before running this pipeline enter your lesion mask in CONN Setup.ROIs tab
as a new ROI, and then select this ROI when prompted during the normalization 
step (and keep the default "TPM secondary dataset" option there unless you
need to specify an alternative TPM map)
