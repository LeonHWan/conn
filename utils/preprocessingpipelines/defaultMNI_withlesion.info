Default MNI Direct-normalization pipeline with structural lesions
Suggested for cases when subjects present structural lesions that we want to
take into accoutn during preprocessing normalization/segmentation steps and 
to discard from voxel- and ROI-level analyses

In addition to the default MNI pipeline steps this pipeline uses a mask of 
each subject structural lesion to improve the structural and functional 
normalization steps. It does so by masking the lesion area during the
structural normalization step and creating an extended Tissue Probability 
Map that incorporates a lesion tissue class to improve the functional
normalization step. This pipeline also normalizes the lesion ROI to
MNI space for further analyses and masks the functional data after normalization

Before running this pipeline enter your lesion mask in CONN Setup.ROIs tab
as a new ROI, and then select:
  - in the normalization settings gui select this ROI as lesion mask
  - in the normalization settings gui select "TPM secondary dataset" option (unless
     you need to specify an alternative TPM map)
  - in the functional masking gui select this ROI and the "exclusive" masking option
