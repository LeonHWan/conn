  CONN_REMOTELY allows you to work and interact with CONN projects stored in any SSH-accessible 
  computer (e.g. projects stored in your own server, or in your institution's cluster-computing environment)
  using the standard SSH protocol for tunneling all communications between your local computer and 
  the computer where the CONN project data is stored
  
  Configuration/Installation: %!
 
  To use this functionality you need to have access to a Linux computer ("server") that is in a network-
  accessible location (e.g. fixed IP address) and that has a SSH server/daemon running, as well as access 
  to a second Linux/Mac/Windows computer ("client") with regular network/internet access and a SSH client 
  installed (e.g. this is already installed by default in your Operating System in Linux & Mac computers). 
 
  Installation in the "server" computer requires the standard installation of SPM/CONN, and also running
  just once as part of the installation procedure the Matlab command "conn_remotely setup" (without quotes),
  which will create a file in your home directory [~/connserverinfo.json] describing the location of
  Matlab, CONN, and SPM packages. This command needs to be run for any user that wishes to access this
  server remotely (alternatively another ~/connserverinfo.json file may be manually copied to a user's
  home directory).
 
  If the "server" computer is part of a HPC or cluster environment, see www.conn-toolbox.org/resources/cluster-configuration 
  for additional HPC/cluster installation instructions. Setting up CONN's cluster/HPC configuration in 
  your "server" computer allows CONN_REMOTELY to also submit jobs to your cluster remotely (from the 
  "client" computer). 
 
  Installation in the "client" computer simply requires the standard installation of SPM/CONN. 
 
  Usage: %!
 
  Start CONN from the "client" computer using the Matlab command:
 
     conn_remotely
  
  When prompted enter:
 
    "Server address" prompt  :      Enter the IP-address of the "server" computer (this may be a login-node in a 
                                    computer cluster environment) 
    "Username" prompt        :      Enter your username in the "server" computer (used to establish an SSH-connection with 
                                    the "server")
    "Password" prompt        :      Enter your password in the "server" computer (note: CONN does not read or record your 
                                    password, this is read by your system's ssh command directly from tty)
 
  After this CONN will launch the standard CONN gui and allow you to load and work with any CONN projects that may be 
  accessible from the "server" computer. When working with a remote project most of the GUI elements will be run locally by 
  the "client" computer and therefore will be as responsive as usual, but some steps in the GUI do require largers amount 
  of data being transferred from the "server" (e.g. when switching to a new tab, or when launching a 3D-view renderer)
  so these may take longer than usual to get started while that data is being transferred, please be patient. Also when
  working with a remote project and running preprocessing or analysis steps you will be offered the option to have those 
  steps run on the "server" computer directly, or have the "server" computer use instead its own HPC/Cluster configuration 
  options to submit a job to its HPC/Cluster environment. 
 
 
  note: if the "server" computer is NOT SSH-accessible (e.g. another computer in your home/office network), the following 
  workaround allows you to still use CONN_REMOTELY funcitonality while setting up the server and the connection manually. 
  Note that this will skip SSH entirely, so in this case your communication data will not be tunneled nor encrypted:
 
    step 1) in the "server" computer, run the Matlab command "conn server" to manually launch a CONN server process
            From the output printed by this command, note the first occurrence of a keyphrase of the form 
            conn_server <IP_address> <numeric_code>CONN<alphanumeric_code> (to be used below)
 
    step 2) in the "client" computer, run "conn_remotely" and then enter:
            2.a) in the "Server address" prompt:                 enter 'none' (without quotes)
            2.b) in the "Remote session host address" prompt:    enter the <IP_address> portion of the keyphrase above
            2.c) in the "Remote session access port" prompt:     enter the <numeric_code> portion of the keyphrase above
            2.d) in the "Remote session id" prompt:              enter the <alphanumeric_code> portion of the keyphrase above
            2.e) in the "Remote session log folder" prompt:      leave empty (press Return)
